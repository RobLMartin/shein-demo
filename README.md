# shein-demo

This is a demo for the team at Shein. I put this together before our live coding session in an attempt to stand out. Looking forward to the in-person in Bellevue.

Before starting this application rename the `sample.env` to `.env` and add a mapbox key.

To start the backend cd into `/backend` and run the command `python3 main.py`.

To start the front-end cd into `/inventory` and run the command `npm run dev`.
